### BUG
 - Sometime image on tile doesn't display correctly. 
This seems to be some issue with JToggleButton that I 
use for the tiles (so I don't think I will be able to 
fix it).
 - Some time the suggestion doesn't show very well (come
of them was missing) but fixed by click on the chess piece
again. I am not sure what is the cause, but I suspect it 
is also something to do with JToggleButton.
